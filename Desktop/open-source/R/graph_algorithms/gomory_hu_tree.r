# Gomory-Hu Tree Algorithm
#
# Constructs a tree representing all-pairs minimum cuts in an undirected weighted graph.
# Each edge weight in the tree corresponds to the minimum cut between its endpoints.
# Useful for efficiently querying min-cut between any two vertices.

gomory_hu_tree <- function(graph) {
  num_vertices <- max(as.numeric(names(graph)))
  parent <- 1:num_vertices
  tree_weight <- rep(0, num_vertices)
  
  min_cut <- function(u, v, graph) {
    # Simple placeholder: here we assume weight of edge u-v is the min-cut.
    # For full implementation, use max-flow algorithms like Edmonds-Karp or Dinic.
    if (v %in% graph[[as.character(u)]]) {
      return(1)  # Example weight
    } else {
      return(Inf)
    }
  }
  
  for (i in 2:num_vertices) {
    w <- min_cut(i, parent[i], graph)
    tree_weight[i] <- w
    # In real algorithm, update parent of vertices based on partition
  }
  
  return(list(parent = parent, weight = tree_weight))
