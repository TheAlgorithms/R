When reviewing a pull request:
- Verify that any added algorithms or data structures arenâ€™t already implemented elsewhere in the repository (including under a different name).
- Confirm that the proposed algorithm is a recognized computer-science algorithm, not a problem-specific adaptation of a general technique (e.g., tuned for LeetCode or other competitive-programming problems).
- Check that the extension of all code file names is a lowercase r.
- Check that DIRECTORY.md was updated correctly.
